# minOperations
 Equalizing Array Elements Given an array of integers, transform it so that at least a certain number of elements in the array are equal.  To achieve this, you can perform an operation where you select an element in the array and divide it by the given division parameter using integer division.  What is the minimum number of operations that must be performed to achieve this goal on a certain array?     For example, let's say arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].  The desired number of equal elements is denoted as threshold = 3, and the division parameter is d = 2.  If you divide the value 4 once and the value 5 once using integer division, you get the array [1, 2, 3, 2, 2], which contains 3 equal elements.  There is no way to achieve this in less than 2 operations. Therefore, the answer is 2.     Function Description  Complete the function minOperations in the editor below.     minOperations has the following parameter(s):      int arr[n]:  an array of integers      int threshold: the minimum number of desired equal elements in the array      int d: the division parameter used to divide an element in a single operation  Returns:      int: the minimum number of operations required to have at least threshold number of equal elements in the array     Constraints  1 ≤ n ≤ 3*104  1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 2*105  1 ≤ threshold ≤ n  2 ≤ d ≤ 1000     Input Format For Custom Testing Sample Case 0 Sample Input For Custom Testing  4 64 30 25 33 2 2 Sample Output  3 Explanation  In this case, arr = [64, 30, 25, 33], threshold = 2, and the division parameter d = 2.  In other words, the minimum required number of equal elements is 2, and in one operation we can divide a single element by 2 using integer division.  If we divide 64 twice to get 16, and we divide 33 once to also get 16, Then the array becomes [16, 30, 25, 16], which has 2 equal elements.  There is no way to get at least 2 equal elements with fewer than 3 operations. Therefore, the answer is 3.
